## What it is
A neural network predicts a hand drawn digit, that is drawn by the user on a canvas.

## How it works
A 4 layer neural network is trained on thousands of data from a keras dataset of handrawn digits.

After training for 5 epochs, it has an accuracy of 98%. It is then used to predict what number the user has drawn into a 28x28 grid.
